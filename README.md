[![Build Status](https://github.com/kaelzhang/shell-safe-rm/actions/workflows/nodejs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kaelzhang/shell-safe-rm/actions/workflows/nodejs.yml)

[Safe-rm][safe-rm], a drop-in and much safer replacement of the unix [`rm`][rm] command with **ALMOST FULL** features of the original [`rm`][rm].

The project was initially developed on Mac OS X and has been continuously used by myself since then, with later testing conducted on Linux. If you encounter any issues during use, please feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/kaelzhang/shell-safe-rm/issues/new).

## Features
- Supports both MacOS and Linux with full test coverage.
- Using `safe-rm`, the files or directories you choose to remove will be moved to the system Trash instead of simply deleting them. You could put them back whenever you want manually.
  - On MacOS, `safe-rm` will use [AppleScript][applescript] to delete files or directories as much as possible to enable the built-in "put-back" capability in the system Trash bin.
  - On Linux, it also follows the operating system's conventions for handling duplicate files in the Trash to avoid overwriting
- Supports Custom [configurations](#configuration).

## Supported options

For those implemented options, safe-rm will act **exactly the same** as the original `rm` command:

| Option | Brief | Description |
| ------ | ----- | ------------ |
| `-i`, `--interactive` | **Interactive** | Prompts you to confirm before removing each file |
| `-I`, `--interactive=once` | **Less Interactive** | Prompts only once before removing more than three files or when recursively removing directories |
| `-f`, `--force` | **Force** | Removes files without prompting for confirmation, ignoring nonexistent files and overriding file protections |
| `-r`, `-R`, `--recursive`, `--Recursive` | **Recursive** | Removes directories and their contents recursively. Required for deleting directories |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | **Verbose** | Displays detailed information about each file or directory being removed |
| `-d`, `--directory` | **Remove Empty Directories** | `safe-rm` can check and only remove empty directories specifically with this flag |
| `-p`, `--permanently` | **Permanently remove** | Permanently remove files like in traditional `rm` |
| `--` | **End of Options** | Used to indicate the end of options. Useful if a filename starts with a `-` |

Combined short options are also supported, such as

`-rf`, `-riv`, `-rfv`, etc

## Usual Installation

Add an alias to your `~/.bashrc` script,

```sh
alias rm='/path/to/bin/rm.sh'
```

and `/path/to` is where you git clone `shell-safe-rm` in your local machine.

## Permanent Installation

If you have NPM ([NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)) installed (RECOMMENDED):

```sh
npm i -g safe-rm
```

Or by using the source code, within the root of the current repo (not recommended, may be unstable):

```sh
# If you have NodeJS installed
npm link

# If you don't have NodeJS or npm installed
make && sudo make install

# For those who have no `make` command:
sudo sh install.sh
```

Installing safe-rm will put `safe-rm` in your `/bin` directory. In order to use
`safe-rm`, you need to add an alias to your `~/.bashrc` script and in all yours
currently open terminals, like this:

```sh
alias rm='safe-rm'
```

After installation and alias definition, when you execute `rm` command in the Terminal, lines of below will be printed:

```sh
$ rm
safe-rm
usage: rm [-f | -i] [-dPRrvW] file ...
     unlink file
```

which helps to tell safe-rm from the original rm.

## Uninstall

First remove the `alias rm=...` line from your `~/.bashrc` file, then

```sh
npm uninstall -g safe-rm
```

Or

```sh
make && sudo make uninstall
```

Or

```sh
sudo sh uninstall.sh
```

# Advanced Sections

## Configuration

Since 3.0.0, you could create a configuration file located at `~/.safe-rm/config` in your `$HOME` directory, to support
- defining your custom trash directory
- allowing `safe-rm` to permanently delete files and directories that are already in the trash
- disallowing `safe-rm` to use [AppleScript][applescript]

For the description of each config, you could refer to the sample file [here](./.safe-rm/config)

```sh
# You could
cp -r ./.safe-rm ~/
```

If you want to use a custom configuration file

```sh
alias="SAFE_RM_CONFIG=/path/to/safe-rm.conf /path/to/shell-safe-rm/bin/rm.sh"
```

Or if it is installed by npm:

```sh
alias="SAFE_RM_CONFIG=/path/to/safe-rm.conf safe-rm"
```

### Disable `Put-back` Functionality on MacOS (MacOS only)

In `~/.safe-rm/config`

```sh
export SAFE_RM_USE_APPLESCRIPT=no
```

By default, on MacOS, `safe-rm` uses AppleScript as much as possible so that removed files could be put back from system Trash app.

### Change the Default Trash Bin Other Than System Default

```sh
export SAFE_RM_TRASH=/path/to/trash
```

### Permanent Delete Files or Directories that Are Already in the Trash

```sh
export SAFE_RM_PERM_DEL_FILES_IN_TRASH=yes
```

### Protect Files And Directories From Deleting

If you want to protect some certain files or directories from deleting by mistake, you could create a `.gitignore` file under the `"~/.safe-rm/"` directory, you could write [.gitignore rules](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) inside the file.

If a path is matched by the rules that defined in `~/.safe-rm/.gitignore`, the path will be protected and could not be deleted by `safe-rm`

For example, in the `~/.safe-rm/.gitignore`

```.gitignore
/path/to/be/protected
```

And when executing

```sh
$ safe-rm /path/to/be/protected           # or
$ safe-rm /path/to/be/protected/foo       # or
$ safe-rm -rf /path/to/be/protected/bar

# An error will occur
```

But pay attention that, by adding the protected pattern above, if we:

```sh
$ safe-rm -rf /path/to
```

To keep the performance of `safe-rm` and avoid conducting unnecessary file system traversing, this would not prevent `/path/to/be/protected/foo` from removing.

Pay **ATTENTION** that:
- Before adding protected rules, i.e. placing the `".gitignore"` inside the `"~/.safe-rm/"` directory, it requires `git` to be installed in your environment
- The `".gitignore"` patterns apply to the root directory (`"/"`), which means that the patterns defined within it need to be relative to the root directory.
- Avoid adding `/` in the protected rules file, or everything will be protected
